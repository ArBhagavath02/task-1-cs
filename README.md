# Number Guessing Game - Java Project

## Overview
The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple console-based Java application. The objective of the game is for the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating if the guess is too high or too low. The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number, and multiple rounds can be played. A score is maintained based on the number of attempts left at the end of each round.

## Features
- **Random Number Generation**: The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 at the start of each round.
- **User Input**: The user is prompted to guess the number and receives feedback.
- **Feedback**: After each guess, the game tells the user if their guess is too high or too low.
- **Limited Attempts**: Users are allowed a limited number of attempts (default is 5) to guess the correct number.
- **Multiple Rounds**: Users can choose to play multiple rounds of the game.
- **Scoring System**: The score is calculated based on how many attempts are left when the user guesses the correct number.
